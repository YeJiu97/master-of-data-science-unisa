# Week_05:Practical#04

**Questions**

1. **Create a project named Prac#4, and in the project, create a diagram named myPrac4.**

1. **Create a data source with the DUNGAREE data set. (you can find the DUNGAREE dataset in Metadata Repository→Shared Data→Libraries→AAEM)**

1. **Determine whether the model roles and measurement levels assigned to the variables are appropriate.**

1. **Examine the distribution of the variables. Are there any unusual data values? Are there missing values that should be replaced?**

1. **Assign the variable STOREID the model role ID and the variable SALESTOT the model role Rejected. Make sure that the remaining variables have the Input model role and the Interval measurement level.**

It wad done before:

**Why should the variable SALESTOT be rejected?**

According to the description “Total number of pairs of jeans sold (the sum of FASHION, LEISURE, STRETCH, and ORIGINAL)”, that variable should not be considered as an independent variable.

1. **Drag the DUNGAREE data source to the diagram workspace to create an Input Data node for a process flow.**

1. **Add a Cluster node to the diagram workspace and connect it to the Input Data node.**

1. **Select the Cluster node. Leave the default setting as Internal Standardization → Standardization. What would happen if inputs were not standardized?**

1. **Run the diagram from the Cluster node and examine the results.**

**Does the number of clusters created seem reasonable?**

The number of resulting clusters is unreasonably large.

1. **Specify a maximum of six clusters and rerun the Cluster node. How does the number and quality of clusters compare to that obtained in part h?**

Except for the market marked as 3, the population of other markets is relatively large.

1. **Use the Segment Profile node to summarize the nature of the clusters. What are the nature/characteristics of each of the 6 clusters, respectively?**
