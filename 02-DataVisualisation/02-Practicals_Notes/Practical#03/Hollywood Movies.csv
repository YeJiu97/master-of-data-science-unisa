And although there were no men in the cast, most of the dialog was about them. The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce, in the 1930's, was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks, and reluctantly divorces him, abetted by her friends, all of whom have romantic problems of their own. In the 1930's New York women who could afford it went to Nevada, where residency could be established quickly and divorce was relatively easy.

His father has become distant, his brother has become angry and bitter, while Taliesin dives into the world of his imagination looking for solace. After witnessing his piano teacher heal a woman's ailing back with the power of prayer, Taliesen begins a spiritual quest. He forms a secret society at his school, ""The Believers"".
